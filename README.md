#Open Source Project: Blog-Website

This is a sample blogging website with a custom js built TextEditor.


Hello Reader....!

I tried creating a blogging website but I think I won't be able to ompelete this my self so I am keeping this as an open source project, you are welcome to contribute to this one.

So the main idea is here. At the fornt page there is some random javascript based animations which work with scroll and slide the text in an out. Keep it like this or you can improve it.

After that there should be a carousal which pulls some highlighted stories form backend. Stories will not be same as blog posts. These are more like animated instagarm stories. 

After that I created some cards to get images from backend which are on the top of every blog post or any first image of the post. The card containes other info too and is enclodes in an anchor. This will lead to the orginal post.
I need a comment section under each post. Plus a like and dislike functioning. Plus login and a user account.

The main attraction in this website is its TextEditor, purely built in JAVASCRIPT and I need it to be in JS only no libraires or frameworks except JQuery. Casue this will help everyone learn more. In ths TextEditor we can write do almost everything which a normal text editor can do but I have some bugs here.

Thats prety much all.

For first version only front end of this application is available. With some errors in front page and in TextEditor. This has also a sample blog post for layout and illutsration purpose.
