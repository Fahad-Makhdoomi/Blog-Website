            <p>There is a lot of talk about crypto currencies. It seems that this is like a revolution in our payments
                and
                currency systems. Cryptocurrencies have gained large attractions among people and just like smartphones
                and
                social media it has already started to have a deep impact on our lives. Reports say that in the year
                2021,
                $30 Bn were invested in crypto worldwide. So what actually are these crypto things? What makes them gain
                such a fan base and what will be its future implications?</p>

            <h3>Lets Dive In</h3>
            <h2>What actually are cryptocurrencies?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Let us look back in time to see how currencies evolved over time. At first humans used to barter things
                for
                things, like if I needed an axe I would present an exchange offer to someone who had it with my sword.
                But
                this was not a better thing to do as the other person may or may not be interested in the thing that I
                would
                like to offer. So to tackle this thing people began to trade things with something that they can be
                assured
                to again exchange later with similar value, like metal and gold. This was something remarkable as now
                people
                had actually developed the idea of currency. But there with time as population grew these resources
                became
                scarce and there was a need to replace them with something that was not scarce, like a paper. But why
                would
                one exchange something for a paper? This was because of the government and ruling powers. These
                developed
                the bills with a promise to pay the bearer in full the sum written on the bill. So as long as there was
                trust in the system this was okay as a common person would definitely trust the governments and the
                governments too will pay the sum. But there was flaw in this system too that sometimes large amounts of
                currencies were printed against the falling value of its economy so people had to keep a load of it to
                buy
                something as small as a loaf of bread, i.e. it was not convenient.</p>

            <p>Hence there developed the idea of plastic
                currency with the advent of banking system. That your money is physically present at one place but you
                can
                access it with a plastic chip based card and the transaction processes will be settled by the bank. But
                as
                we became digitally more advanced the money in the bank became only records or figures maintained and
                looked
                after by the banks and there computers. Also more and more transactions shifted online the transaction
                was
                no longer the physical transfer of money but only the mere addition and subtraction in figures
                digitally.
                Hence the idea for cryptocurrencies was developed which doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions.
                It's a
                peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. When you transfer
                cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in
                digital
                wallets.</p>
